This folder contains the raw inkscape svg files with the figures I used in each post.

**This images are cool! Can I reuse them?** You can reuse the images and modify them, however if you are a nice person please cite my name or add a reference to my page( Massimiliano Patacchiola: http://mpatacchiola.github.io/).

**What should I expect if I misbehave?** I will sue you and my expensive lawyers will destroy your life.
