What is this?
-------------

This repository contains the code for a series of blog post called "dissecting reinforcement learning" which I published on my blog [mpatacchiola.io/blog](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/). Moreover there are links to resources that can be useful for a reinforcement learning practitioner. **If you have some good references to add please send me a pull request and I will integrate them in the main file**.

The source code is contained in [src](./src) with the name of the subfolders following the post number. In [pdf](./pdf) there are the A3 documents of each post for offline reading. In [images](./images) there are the raw svg file containing the images used in each post.
