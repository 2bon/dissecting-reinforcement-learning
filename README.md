What is this?
-------------

This repository contains the code for a series of blog post called "dissecting reinforcement learning" which I published on my blog [mpatacchiola.io/blog](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/).

The code is organised into different folders. The name of the folders follows the post number.
